# Simon-Says-Game

This was a very fun project given to me by Angela Yu of my Udemy course. 

I pushed initially with only what she wanted me to make, however I added some revisions later on. 
This includes a restart button.

After the restart button push, I had a bug where it wouldn't actually restart the game, so I fixed that bug and also
added a message that displays if you try playing the game before "starting" the game. 

This was a very fun and challenging project. I enjoyed debugging it and adding my own features and twist onto it
to get some more practice with DOM, jQuery, and JavaScript in general.
